NPM Modules

1. Request - Use this to make HTTP requests to APIs
    - Deprecated but can substitute with postman-request and use exactly the same

2. Express - Ability to create a web server with Node
    - app.get('',(req, res) => {}) - this function takes a route and a function that describes what to do when someone visits a route.
        - first argument in callback is an object that contains information about the request coming in and response allows customization of what is going to be sent back.

    -res.send() - sends something to be rendered by the browser
    -app.listen() - takes the port to start the server in, and takes a callback when the port is opened
    -res.render() - render a view
        -In order to render a view you must specify the absolute path in the res.render function
    -app.use() - customize server
    -express.static() - Function that takes folder that will be served
    -app.set() - set a value for an express setting
